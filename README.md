# celluloid-lua-plugins
Plugins for [Celluloid Player](https://github.com/celluloid-player/celluloid), powered by MPV and Lua.


If you want to write your own Lua scripts, have a look at the documentation of mpv's Lua interface. (https://mpv.io/manual/master/#lua-scripting)


Want your plugin listed here? Let me know and I will update the readme to link to your repo asap! Discord: https://discord.gg/YNp6T7vZxm


Celluloid should work with some/most mpv plugins and you can find them here [MPV Plugins](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/User-Scripts)
